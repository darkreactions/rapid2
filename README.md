Repo that contains RAPID2 data and visualizations


# To do
- Data comes from WF3 - What is the latest dataset? - Have latest
- Different statespaces. How to generate? - Ian
- Which experimental conditions to display? - _rxn_mixingtime2_s _rxn_mixingtime_s	_rxn_reactiontime_s	_rxn_stirrate_rpm and concentrations
- Both LBL and HC? - Just LBL
- What are the other axes? (Formic acid and Lead iodide)

# Writing task for Shekar
Capabilities of visualization? How is it different in terms of communicating data?
