## Repository contents
The following sections indicate the folders which contain code and related data

### Jupyter notebooks

1. RAPID2.ipynb - Notebook containing all visualizations and reaction outcomes

### Raw data
All raw data files are located in the ```data``` folder

1. Diffusion_rate_and_crystal_height_all_CSV- Contains .csv files of extracted solvent heights and crystal growth time
2. cifs - Contains the Crystallographic Information Files
3. csv_for_notebook - Contains the .csv files for running Jupyter notebook
4. images - Contains the image files for running Jupyter notebook
5. visible_nucleation_images - Contains the image files of first apperence of nucleation (used for running Jupyter notebook)
6. xrd/xy - Contains xy files for XRD data
7. 0042.perovskitedata_RAPID.csv - Escalate generated data file including 8 experimental features (with "_rxn_" as header prefix) and 67 chemical features (with "_feat_" as header prefix). The detailed explanations of these features are listed in "Explanation of Features-Descriptors" section in "Perovskite Dataset Description.pdf". This CSV file is used in visualization and machine learning. 
8. 0042.perovskitedata_RAPID_full.csv - This escalate generated data file contains the same experiments as "0042.perovskitedata_RAPID.csv" but has all 787 features, including additional "_raw_" features describing experiment details (see "Explanation of Features-Descriptors" section in "Perovskite Dataset Description" for the explanations of "_raw_" prefix). The csv file is not used for visualization or machine learning. 
9. image_list.json - Keeps track of all image files in the image folder
10. ml_data.pkl - Python pickle file containing ML results
11. inventory.csv - Chemical inventory data
12. organic_inchikey.csv - Inchi keys and chemical names
13. s_spaces.json - Co-ordinates of state space for each amine

### Scripts in src folder

The following python scripts are used for data generation in this study

1. get_liquid_height_and_crystal_start.py - code for extracting solvent heights and crystal formation time from the reaction images
2. diffusion_coefficient_measurement.py - code for extracting curve height from the laser diffusion experiment to calculate diffusion coefficient
3. diff_coeff_analysis.ipynb - Script for calculating diffusion coefficient value from the data generated by laser diffusion experiment
4. 'diffusion_model_scripts' folder contains Matlab scripts for running diffusion model

# Todo for SHEKAR
1. Move 'diff_coeff_analysis.ipynb' from 'diffusion_coeff' folder to 'src'
2. Remove xrd folder from data
3. Remove following files from data (if not used anywhere else)

0000.perovskitedata.csv

0052.4-Data-WF3_Iodide.csv

0056.perovskitedata.csv

Final_Results_11_3_20.csv

Reaction Summary - Uniform_Concentration.csv

WF3_Iodides_20191211b.csv

first_pass_decision_tree_rapid2.pdf

only4_diffusion_topcolmn.xlsx

reaction_summary.csv

second_pass_decision_tree_rapid2.pdf

training_set_redone_mansoor.csv

4. Add the following files to 'data' folder instead (shared in slack on 01/15/22)
